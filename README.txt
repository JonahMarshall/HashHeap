HashHeap is a hashmap that stores into a MinHeap.

This project is more of a proof of concept than a full implementation. 
There were two questions I had when deciding to make this. 

1. How would one implement a hash function when you don't know the data type?
2. Would a hash table that uses heaps instead of linked lists be more efficient because of the O(logn)
insert time?

The Current iteration of HashHeap has many missing features that would be required for actual usage.
